Drought is generally considered, and therefore treated, as natural hazard; a phenomenon that can impact health, create property damage, cause social economic disruption or environmental damage, and result into life losses . Drought is often called “creeping disaster” since it is difficult to monitor its development, whereas it complex system has ambiguous influence boundaries <a href="#markmin_2">[2]</a>.</p><h2>European Drought Economic Impacts</h2><p>During the last 30 years, Europe has been affected by several drought events (1976, 1989, 1991, 2003) making drought as one of the major weather – water deficit related hazard <a href="#markmin_10">[10]</a>.The annual economic impact since 1991 is estimated to €5.3 billion whereas the economic cost of 2003 severe drought event (associated with summer heat wave) is estimated to €8.7 billion <a href="#markmin_2">[2]</a>. As a result, drought prediction is of great importance for planning and management of water resources. Generally, drought is caused by the deficiency in precipitation <a href="#markmin_1">[1]</a>. However, drought is not a universally accepted definition since its process complexity varies in time scales and further impacts operations.</p><h2>Drought Definitions</h2><p><strong>World Meteorological Organization</strong> (WMO, 1986) deﬁnes drought as: <em>“Drought means a sustained, extended deﬁciency in precipitation”</em></p><p><strong>UN Convention to Combat Drought and Desertiﬁcation</strong> deﬁnes drought as: <em>“Drought means the naturally occurring phenomenon that exists when precipitation has been signiﬁcantly below normal recorded levels, causing serious hydrological imbalances that adversely affect land resource production systems”</em></p><p><strong>European Drought Center</strong> defines drought as: <em>“Drought means a sustained and regionally extensive occurrence of below average natural water availability”</em></p><p><div class="content">

<h2>Drought versus Aridity, Heat Wave and Water Scarcity</h2>The controversial drought definitions show some confusion, particularly over the difference between drought and aridity, heat wave or water scarcity. Aridity is a permanent characteristic of climate associated to regions with low precipitation and usually high heat wave. The difference between aridity and heat wave is emphasized in the time span; heat waves typically have temporal scales of a weak <a href="#markmin_2">[2]</a>.<br> According to the European Commission of the Environment, water scarcity defines regions which are subject to insufficient water resources to satisfy long-term average requirements. Water scarcity refers to long-term water imbalances, combining low water availability with a level of water demand exceeding the supply capacity of the natural system (two types: Physical Water Scarcity and Economic Water Scarcity) <a href="#markmin_6">[6]</a> .<p> In additionn, water scarcity occurs when water demand, including all natural and human sectors, is higher than the available water resources.</p><br style="height:50px"/><h2>Drought Types</h2><p>The hydro-meteorological conditions and the socioeconomic factors used for research-policy making define the drought types.</p><p>Five major types of drought are defined:</p><ul><li>Meteorological: temporal reduction of precipitation during long periods. Note that the use of meteorological drought indices does not take into account human impacts, i.e. irrigation, on water balance <a href="#markmin_4">[4]</a> (see Figure 1)</li><li>Hydrological: long period of inadequate surface and subsurface water resources</li><li>Agricultural: decline of soil moisture which further affects crops</li><li>Social economic: failure of water resources to meet water demands (can also be found as water resource drought)</li><li>Groundwater.</li></ul><h2>Drought Indices</h2><p>To identify, quantify and monitor drought phenomena various statistical measures (drought indices; DI) have been proposed primarily based on hydro-meteorological (and sometimes other) information <a href="#markmin_5">[5]</a>. According to Mishra et al. (2011), <em>drought index is a prime variable assessing the effect of a drought and defining different drought parameter, which includes intensity, duration, severity and spatial extent</em>.</p><p>Several drought indices which are able to define events and periods of drought have been developed. However note that those single metrics can describe the complex process of a system through a numerical value; and hence, are based on assumptions and simplifications regardless the complexity of the drought.</p><p>The identification of drought indices generally depends on the: i) Frequency (how often drought events occur in selected time periods) ii) Time scale (e.g. 2 months precipitation deficit) iii) Intensity iv) Spatial extent (e.g. local or global scale).</p><p>Prior to the application of a drought index, three basic notions must clearly be defined:</p><ul><li>Firstly, the “normal” condition of the case study area. Understanding of the water balance in the region is required, particularly if drought is applied to small size areas. For instance, tourism in Aegean islands increases during the summer season, hence water demands, increasing the risk of drought in the following months.</li><li>Secondly, as a result of the normal conditions, the time step and the reference period of the drought indicator must carefully be selected.</li><li>Finally, drought is likely to spatially extend more than the hydrological basin.</li></ul><p>Drought indices can be grouped into two categories: general indices (providing an overview of the occurrence) and severity and specific indices (useful in correlation of drought events to the several drought impacts) <a href="#markmin_4">[4]</a>. As a result, a number of different indices of various potential have been developed. Most widely applied are: Palmer Index, Rainfall Anomaly Index, deciles, surface water supply index, standardized precipitation index, soil moisture index and others <a href="#markmin_7">[7]</a> <a href="#markmin_2">[2]</a>.</p><h2>Drought Characteristics</h2><p>A key characteristic of drought is the intensity or severity duration, and is defined as the deficit of water availability, water storage, from the arithmetic mean (in statistical terms) – normal long term region.</p><h2>Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)</h2><p>SPI is a probability index able to represent abnormal dryness or wetness (McKee et al., 1993). SPI uses observed precipitation as the only input and can be easily calculated for any region.</p><p>Firstly, SPI calculates the probability density function that best fits the precipitation distribution in different time scales. The time scales can vary from 1 to (usually) 48 months. Data are fitted to a probability distribution, and further transformed to normal distribution with mean SPI values equal to zero (several studies present a detailed description of the SPI algorithm and its application)</p><p>SPI has several advantages compared to other drought indices <a href="#markmin_9">[9]</a>. The index is simple and only requires precipitation as input. In addition, application at different time scales reveals the variable impact of drought. Finally, data standardization (transformation at unit normal distribution) allows direct comparison of different distributions, fitted to the data, at any location with the same time scale. However, as SPI is a statistical index, it is restricted to the length of records (i.e. requires a statistical significant length of data) and the nature of the suitable theoretical probability distribution.</p><h2>Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI)</h2><p>RDI was firstly presented in the MEDROPLAN project in March 2004. The index is based on the ratio between two aggregated quantities of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration <a href="#markmin_3">[3]</a>.</p><p>Apart from the original definition, two more can be found: the Normalized RDI and the Standardized RDI. Standardized RDI is computed following a similar strategy to the original SPI; however the standardized SPI basically assumes that data follow a log-normal distribution at the different time scales.</p><p>RDI has some advantages towards the other indices since it has a more physically based structure, reflecting the water balance of a region as described by precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Similarly to SPI, RDI can be calculated for different time scales and can be used under a “varying/changing climate”. In addition, it should be noted that RDI is generally more suitable at semi-arid climatic zones, such as the Mediterranean, where evapotranspiration losses dominate the water cycle. However, the index is limited to data quality and their statistical significance (length of precipitation records and the nature of the probability distribution). Finally, the potential evapotranspiration is empirically calculated using, for instance, the Turk or Thronthwaite equations; hence adding uncertainty.</p><br style="height:50px"/><br style="height:50px"/>
